# xv6
This was a course in my Level 3 Term 1.The name clearly suggests this is a course on Compiler. We were given four assignments that gradually builds a C compiler using various tools like YACC,BISON.

1 Symbol Table
A Symbol Table management was developed from scrach in C++

2 Lexical Analyser
Lexical Analyser was built using YACC.

3 Syntax & Semantic Analyser
The parsed token in Lexical Analyser was combined with BISON to build a Syntax & Semantic Analyser.

4 Intermediate Code Generation, Optimization
In the final stage all the previous works are combined to generate assembly code for Intel 8086 processor. So, given a subset of C code as text,the compiler would assembly code for Intel 8086 processor. Also the assembly code is optimized to reduce etra variable.

I also handled function calls,recurrsive function calls. Unfortunately due to Ubuntu failure I've lost the code for the final assignment!
